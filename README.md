# Pigflux RNA-seq
Analysis of RNA-seq normalized counts for pig flux data

## source files
script for heatmap generation and pathway comparisons between diets.R - R scripts used to produce figures and analyze statistics on RNA-seq data
batch-adjusted counts based only set all pigs.csv - sva-adjusted RNA-Seq counts from pig tissues, adjustments were performed across two batches of RNA-seq library prep and sequencing
uniprot-human-genes and goterms mapping.tab - Gene ontology terms used to analyze cumulative effects of diet across organs on pathways

## RNA-Seq analyses of transporters in Bae et al., 2025
raw data used to perform PCA and Differential expression across pig organs fed a HFHS or control diet:
normalized gene counts following batch adjustment: pan-organ transporter counts.csv
list of know metabolite transporters used to analyze: metabolite transporter genes.csv
Combined results from differential expression (HFHS/Ct) each organ: TRANSPORTER ONLY DE results tissue-specific
