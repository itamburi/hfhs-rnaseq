## RNA-Seq analyses of transporters in Bae et al., 2025
raw data used to perform PCA and Differential expression across pig organs fed a HFHS or control diet:

**Normalized gene counts following batch adjustment:** pan-organ transporter counts.csv

**list of know metabolite transporters used to analyze:** metabolite transporter genes.csv

**Combined results from differential expression (HFHS/Ct) each organ:** TRANSPORTER ONLY DE results tissue-specific
